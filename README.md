# HotDeathR

Hi, Welcome to the repo for HotDeathR. Since the origonall repo is abondened, I'm starting to do work on this.  I'm peronsally not too experenced at this, but HotDeathR is a redesign of the android game. I hope to make this game "persentable" in the future. No promices, though. 


# Hot Death Readme:

Hot Death is a variation of the classic card game, Uno.

This is a labor of love for me, as I have enjoyed the original Hot Death Uno for many years. I wish I had more specifics about who invented it, but I first saw it in electronic form in the mid 90s, as a Visual Basic application for Windows. I ported it to Pocket PC in the early 2000s, and now it is here for Android.
